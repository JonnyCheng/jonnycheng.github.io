My name is Jony Cheng, a front-end software engineer at Beijing. I’ve been working on the web professionally since 2013.

Jony's blog is a place where I jot down the ideas I think about outside of work.

I prefer writing about more abstract topics, occasionally I’ll bring up a specific technology as well.

If you’re interested in my blog, let me know.
