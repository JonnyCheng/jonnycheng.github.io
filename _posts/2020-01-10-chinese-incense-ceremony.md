## Introduction

Rooted in pre-Qin ritual sacrifices and refined by Tang-Song literati, Chinese incense ceremony is an Eastern art of living that weaves philosophy and aesthetics through natural aromatics. Artisans blend rare materials like agarwood, sandalwood, and ambergris using ancient "harmonized incense" techniques, crafting ritual forms such as seal incense, aromatic pellets, and ceremonial cakes. The curling smoke embodies the aesthetic concept of "perceiving truth through scent". Beyond Buddhist/Taoist rites and imperial gatherings, incense served as Confucian self-cultivation – Lu You sought clarity through "burning incense while contemplating art," while Huang Tingjian's Ten Virtues of Incense metaphorically linked fragrance with human virtues. The artistry extends to implements: Xuande bronze censers showcase unparalleled metallurgy, while bamboo-carved incense tubes reflect scholarly elegance, both manifesting the unity of heaven and humanity. Today’s revival transforms this olfactory wisdom into a bridge connecting modern souls to ancestral traditions through meditative fragrance rituals.
