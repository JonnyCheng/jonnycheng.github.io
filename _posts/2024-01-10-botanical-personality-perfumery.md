## Introduction

The IACA Natural Herbal Perfumery Course is an ancient craft that harmonizes science, art, and natural healing - serving as both an exploration of scents and an awakening of emotions and memories.

This program systematically teaches core techniques in natural plant essential oil perfumery and synthetic fragrance blending, while providing hands-on guidance in creating aromatic products like perfumes, energy sprays, and flameless aroma diffusers. Whether you're a fragrance enthusiast, handcrafted wellness entrepreneur, or a professional seeking skill enhancement, you'll embark on an immersive olfactory journey through this course.
