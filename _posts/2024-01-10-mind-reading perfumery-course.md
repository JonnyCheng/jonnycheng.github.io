## Introduction

Have you ever been instantly captivated by a particular scent—perhaps the jasmine fragrance on your childhood street or the cedar aroma encountered during a journey? These natural fragrances often touch our hearts in unexpected ways. Now, you’ll have the chance to become a creator of fragrance and, through the "spiritual mirror" of mind-reading, engage in a deep dialogue with yourself as you blend scents.

## Who Should Attend

1. Fragrance Enthusiasts: Tired of generic commercial perfumes, eager to craft a unique scent that’s unmistakably “you.”

2. Aromatherapy Practitioners: Master the dual skills of fragrance creation and mind-reading consultation to offer clients profound healing—from olfactory delight to spiritual nourishment.

3. Psychotherapists: Add a “non-verbal communication tool” to your practice, unlocking clients’ subconscious through imagery and fragrance.

4. Handmade Studio Owners: Develop high-value “custom fragrance + mind-reading experience sessions” to build unique competitiveness for your studio.

5. Self-Explorers: Use the dialogue between fragrance and mind-reading to reconnect with your unrecognized inner self during the art of perfumery.

## Program Content

1. Foundations of Perfume Blending

2. Natural Essential Oils

3. Mind-Reading Perfumery

4. Expansion & Application

## Course Highlights

1. Dual Physical and Mental Healing: Perfumery as Meditation
   When blending scents, focus on olfaction naturally triggers a “flow state”; during mind-reading, visual guidance brings the subconscious to light.

2. Personalized Growth: Your Needs Always Prioritized
   Specialized “Basic Reinforcement Workshops” and “Advanced Formula Seminars” are available—beginners start with essential oil classification, while experienced learners explore the connection between essential oil molecules and emotional brain regions.
